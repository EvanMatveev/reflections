When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    So that if something happens to your local drive, you'll always be able to restore your files frome the remote repository. Also, it makes the process of co-working much easier...

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because it will make the process of cooperation a lot easier...
